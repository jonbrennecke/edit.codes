NAME
       gcloud-compute-target-pools-add-instance - Add instances to a target
       pool

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-pools add-instance NAME --instances INSTANCE
       [INSTANCE ...] [--region REGION] [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools add-instance is used to add one or more
       instances to a target pool. For more information on health checks and
       load balancing, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target pool to which to add the instances.

FLAGS
       --instances INSTANCE [INSTANCE ...]
           Specifies a list of instances that will receive traffic directed to
           this target pool. Each entry must be specified by a relative or
           fully-qualified path to the instance (e.g., "--instances
           us-central1-a/instances/my-instance"). All instances in one target
           pool must belong to the same region as the target pool. Instances
           do not need to exist at the time the target pool is created and can
           be created afterwards.

       --region REGION
           The region of the target pool.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
