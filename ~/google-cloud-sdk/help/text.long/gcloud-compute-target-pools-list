NAME
       gcloud-compute-target-pools-list - List Google Compute Engine target
       pools

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-pools list [NAME_REGEX ...] [--limit LIMIT]
       [--raw-links] [--regions REGION [REGION ...]] [--sort-by SORT_BY] [-h,
       --help] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools list lists the URIs of Google Compute
       Engine target pools in a project. The "-l" option can be used to
       display summary data such as the backup pool or session affinity for
       each target pool. Users who want to see more data should use gcloud
       compute target-pools get.

       By default, target pools from all regions are listed. The results can
       be narrowed down by providing "--region".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME_REGEX ...]
           Name regular expressions used to filter the resources fetched. The
           regular expressions must conform to the re2 syntax (see
           https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax).

FLAGS
       --limit LIMIT
           The maximum number of results.

       --raw-links
           If provided, resource references in output from the server will not
           be condensed for readability. For example, when listing operations,
           if a targetLink is
           "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central2-a/instances/my-instance",
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is shown for brevity. This
           behavior can be turned off using this flag.

       --regions REGION [REGION ...]
           If provided, only resources from the given regions are queried.

       --sort-by SORT_BY
           A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
           value of this flag with a tilde ("~").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.

       -l
           If provided, prints a human-readable table of useful resource data.
           The columns of the table do not necessarily map one-to-one to the
           properties defined in the API. For example, the external IP address
           of an instance is displayed under the "externalIP" column, but in
           the API the external IP address is stored under
           "networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP". The table output is
           for convenience and should not be taken to reflect the API
           verbatim.
