NAME
       gcloud-compute-instances-set-scheduling - Set scheduling options for
       Google Compute Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute instances set-scheduling INSTANCE [--maintenance-policy
       MAINTENANCE_POLICY] [--no-restart-on-failure | --restart-on-failure]
       [--zone ZONE] [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       $gcloud compute instances set-scheduling is used to configure
       scheduling options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       INSTANCE
           The name of, or a fully- or partially-qualified path to the
           instance for which to set scheduling options. Using a path
           containing the zone will render the --zone flag optional. For
           example, providing "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is
           equivalent to providing "my-instance" with "--zone us-central2-a".

FLAGS
       --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY
           Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
           undergo maintenance. TERMINATE indicates that the instances should
           be terminated. MIGRATE indicates that the instances should be
           migrated to a new host. Choosing MIGRATE will temporarily impact
           the performance of instances during a migration event.

       --no-restart-on-failure
           If provided, the instances will not be restarted automatically if
           they are terminated by the system. Mutually exclusive with
           --restart-on-failure. This does not affect terminations performed
           by the user.

       --restart-on-failure
           If provided, the instances will be restarted automatically if they
           are terminated by the system. This flag is mutually exclusive with
           "--no-restart-on-failure". This does not affect terminations
           performed by the user.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
