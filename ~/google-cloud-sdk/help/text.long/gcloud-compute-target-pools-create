NAME
       gcloud-compute-target-pools-create - Define a load-balanced pool of
       virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-pools create NAME [--backup-pool BACKUP_POOL]
       [--description DESCRIPTION] [--failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO]
       [--health-checks HEALTH_CHECK [HEALTH_CHECK ...]] --instances INSTANCE
       [INSTANCE ...] [--region REGION] [--session-affinity SESSION_AFFINITY;
       default="NONE"] [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools create is used to create a target pool. A
       target pool resource defines a group of instances that can receive
       incoming traffic from forwarding rules. When a forwarding rule directs
       traffic to a target pool, Google Compute Engine picks an instance from
       the target pool based on a hash of the source and destination IP
       addresses and ports. For more information on load balancing, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target pool.

FLAGS
       --backup-pool BACKUP_POOL
           Together with "--failover-ratio", this flag defines the fallback
           behavior of the target pool (primary pool) to be created by this
           command. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool
           is at or below the specified "--failover-ratio value", then traffic
           arriving at the load-balanced IP address will be directed to the
           backup pool. If this flag is provided, then "--failover-ratio" is
           required.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional description of this target pool.

       --failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO
           Together with "--backup-pool", defines the fallback behavior of the
           target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command. If the
           ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below
           this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP address will
           be directed to the backup pool. For example, if 0.4 is chosen as
           the failover ratio, then traffic will fail over to the backup pool
           if more than 40% of the instances become unhealthy. If not set, the
           traffic will be directed the instances in this pool in the "force"
           mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with
           the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy.
           If this flag is provided, then "--backup-pool" is required.

       --health-checks HEALTH_CHECK [HEALTH_CHECK ...]
           Specifies HTTP health check resources to use to determine the
           health of instances in this pool. If no health check is specified,
           traffic will be sent to all instances in this target pool as if the
           instances were healthy, but the health status of this pool will
           appear as unhealthy as a warning that this target pool does not
           have a health check.

       --instances INSTANCE [INSTANCE ...]
           Specifies a list of instances that will receive traffic directed to
           this target pool. Each entry must be specified by a relative or
           fully-qualified path to the instance (e.g., "--instances
           us-central1-a/instances/my-instance"). All instances in one target
           pool must belong to the same region as the target pool. Instances
           do not need to exist at the time the target pool is created and can
           be created afterwards.

       --region REGION
           The region in which the forwarding rule will be created.

       --session-affinity SESSION_AFFINITY
           Specifies the session affinity option for the connection. If "NONE"
           is selected, then connections from the same client IP address may
           go to any instance in the target pool. If "CLIENT_IP" is selected,
           then connections from the same client IP address will go to the
           same instance in the target pool. If "CLIENT_IP_PROTO" is selected,
           then connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol
           will go to the same client pool. If not specified, then "NONE" is
           used as a default.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
