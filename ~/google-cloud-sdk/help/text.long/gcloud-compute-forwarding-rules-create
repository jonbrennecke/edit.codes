NAME
       gcloud-compute-forwarding-rules-create - Create a forwarding rule to
       direct network traffic to a load balancer

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules create NAME [--address ADDRESS]
       [--description DESCRIPTION] [--ip-protocol IP_PROTOCOL] [--port-range
       PORT-PORT] [--region REGION] [--target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE |
       --target-pool TARGET_POOL] [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules create is used to create a forwarding
       rule. Forwarding rules match and direct certain types of traffic to a
       load balancer which is controlled by a target pool or a single instance
       that is controlled by a target instance. For more information on load
       balancing, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

       When creating a forwarding rule, either "--target-instance" or
       "--target-pool" must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the forwarding rule.

FLAGS
       --address ADDRESS
           The external IP address that the forwarding rule will serve. All
           traffic sent to this IP address is directed to the virtual machines
           that are in the target pool pointed to by the forwarding rule. If
           the value is a reserved IP address, the address must live in the
           same region as the forwarding rule. If this flag is omitted, an
           ephemeral IP address is assigned.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional textual description for the forwarding rule.

       --ip-protocol IP_PROTOCOL
           The IP protocol that the rule will serve. If left empty, TCP is
           used. Supported protocols are: AH, ESP, SCTP, TCP, UDP.

       --port-range PORT-PORT
           If specified, only packets addressed to ports in the specified
           range will be forwarded. If not specified, all ports are matched.

       --region REGION
           The region in which the forwarding rule will be created

       --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE
           The target instance that will receive the traffic. The target
           instance must be in a zone that's part of the forwarding rule's
           region. The value of this flag can be either the URI of the target
           instance or a suffix of it containing the zone such as
           "us-central2-a/targetInstances/my-target-instance".

       --target-pool TARGET_POOL
           The target pool that will receive the traffic.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
