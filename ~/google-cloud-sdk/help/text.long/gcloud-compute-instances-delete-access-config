NAME
       gcloud-compute-instances-delete-access-config - Delete an access
       configuration from the network interface of a virtual machine

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute instances delete-access-config NAME
       [--access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"]
       [--network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"] [--zone ZONE]
       [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances delete-access-config is used to delete access
       configurations from network interfaces of Google Compute Engine virtual
       machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of, or a fully- or partially-qualified path to the
           instance from which to delete the access configuration. Using a
           path containing the zone will render the --zone flag optional. For
           example, providing "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is
           equivalent to providing "my-instance" with "--zone us-central2-a".

FLAGS
       --access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME
           Specifies the name of the access configuration to delete.
           "external-nat" is used as the default if this flag is not provided.

       --network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE
           Specifies the name of the network interface from which to delete
           the access configuration. If this is not provided, then "nic0" is
           used as the default.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance from which to delete the access
           configuration.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
