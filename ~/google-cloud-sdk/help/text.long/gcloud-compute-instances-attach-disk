NAME
       gcloud-compute-instances-attach-disk - Attach a disk to an instance

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute instances attach-disk INSTANCE [--device-name
       DEVICE_NAME] --disk DISK [--mode MODE; default="rw"] [--zone ZONE] [-h,
       --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
       instance. For example,

           $ compute instances attach-disk my-instance --disk my-disk
             --zone us-central1-a

       attaches the disk named "my-disk" to the instance named "my-instance"
       in zone "us-central1-a".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       INSTANCE
           The name of, or a fully- or partially-qualified path to the
           instance to which the disk should be attached. Using a path
           containing the zone will render the --zone flag optional. For
           example, providing "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance" is
           equivalent to providing "my-instance" with "--zone us-central2-a".

FLAGS
       --device-name DEVICE_NAME
           An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
           system will see.

       --disk DISK
           The name of, or a fully- or partially-qualified path to the disk to
           attach to the instance. Using a path containing the zone will
           render the --zone flag optional. For example, providing
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-disk" is equivalent to providing
           "my-disk" with "--zone us-central2-a".

       --mode MODE
           Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are "ro" for
           read-only and "rw" for read-write. If omitted, "rw" is used as a
           default. It is an error to attach a disk in read-write mode to more
           than one instance.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone in which the instance and disk reside.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
