NAME
       gcloud-compute-copy-files - Copy files to and from Google Compute
       Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute copy-files [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SOURCE
       [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SOURCE ...] [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST [--recursive, -r]
       [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE] [--zone ZONE] [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute copy-files copies files between virtual machines and
       your local machine. Under the covers, scp(1) is used to facilitate the
       transfer. Hosts involved can only be Compute Engine Virtual machines
       and your local machine.

       To denote a remote file, prefix the file name with the virtual machine
       instance's name (e.g., "my-instance:/my-file"). To denote a local file,
       do not add a prefix to the file name (e.g., "/my-file"). For example,
       to copy a number of remote files to a local directory, you can run:

           $ gcloud compute copy-files \
               my-instance-1:~/file-1 \
               my-instance-2:~/file-2 \
               ~/my-destination \
               --zone us-central2-a

       In the above example, "/file-1" from "my-instance-1" and "/file-2" from
       "my-instance-2" are copied to the local directory "~/my-destination".

       Conversely, files from your local compute can be copied to the virtual
       machines:

           $ gcloud compute copy-files \
               ~/my-file \
               my-instance:~/remote-destination \
               --zone us-central2-a

       Note that the zone of the instances were provided using "--zone". It's
       possible to specify the zone on a per-instance basis by using
       partially-qualified paths:

           $ gcloud compute copy-files \
               us-central2-a/instances/my-instance-1:~/file-1 \
               europe-west1-a/instnaces/my-instance-2:~/file-2 \
               ~/my-destination

       When omitting "--zone", fight the urge to use full URIs for the
       instances (e.g.,
       "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/my-instance")
       because positional arguments are split on the first colon.

       If a local file contains a colon (":"), you can specify it by either
       using an absolute path or a path that begins with "./".

       Copies involving a remote source and a remote destination will go
       through the local host. This is done because in most cases, a remote
       source will not know the remote destination's host key fingerprint, so
       a direct copy will likely fail. If performance is important (e.g.,
       large files), SSH into the remote destination and issue the copy
       command from there.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [[USER@]INSTANCE:]SOURCE [[[USER@]INSTANCE:]SOURCE ...]
           Specifies a source file.

       [[USER@]INSTANCE:]DEST
           Specifies a destination for the source files.

FLAGS
       --recursive
           Recursively copy entire directories.

       --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE
           The path to the SSH key file. By deault, this is
           "~/.ssh/google_compute_engine".

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instances.

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
