NAME
       gcloud-compute-target-instances-create - Create a target instance for
       handling traffic from a forwarding rule

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-instances create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
       --instance INSTANCE [--zone ZONE] [-h, --help]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-instances create is used to create a target
       instance for handling traffic from one or more forwarding rules. Target
       instances are ideal for traffic that should be managed by a single
       source. For more information on target instances, see
       https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/protocol-forwarding/#targetinstances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target instance.

FLAGS
       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description of the target instance.

       --instance INSTANCE
           The name of the virtual machine instance that will handle the
           traffic.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the target instance (i.e., where the instance resides).
           This flag can be omitted if the zone is included in the
           "--instance" flag (e.g., "us-central2-a/instances/my-instance") or
           in the name of the target instance (e.g.,
           "us-central2-a/instances/my-target-instance").

       --help
           Print a summary help and exit.
